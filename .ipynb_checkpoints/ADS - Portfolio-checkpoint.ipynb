    "### What is a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)?\n",
    "Generative Adversarial Network (referred to as GAN) is a network that generates new data with the same internal structure as the training data. They can be described as generative models based on supervised learning.\n",
    "It consists of 2 Neural Networks models, the generator (which defines takes random noise and generates samples), and a discriminator (which takes the above sample, and tries to determine if it is fake or real). At each step, we try to minimize the loss for both models, until the point where the generator produces samples virtually indistinguishable from the real images, for the discriminator.\n",
    "The network itself can be thought of as a game between the 2 models, both competing to win.\n",
    "To gain more insight into this, refer to the following paper published by Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues, explaining their motivation behind this.<br>\n",
    "[GAN paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are new to Neural Networks, checkout this video. It is a good starting point in understanding what they are and how do they work.<br>\n",

    "### Why GAN?\n",
    "GANs are cited as the most interesting idea in the last ten years by the Yann LeCun, the director of AI at Facebook. This intrigued me to understand the working of this algorithm.\n",
    "<br>Since its inception, there have been various improvements published. Most of these are around image generation.\n",
    "In this paper, I am trying to train the model using a custom image set of only 100 images as training data. The original paper used a CelebA dataset provided by imagenet consisting of 200k images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Trying to get a stable working model using a small dataset, I am trying to see the impact of changing the hyper parameters, as well as modifying the neural network itself."
